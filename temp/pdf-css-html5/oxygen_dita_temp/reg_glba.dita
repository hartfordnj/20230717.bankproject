Prior to GLBA, companies were confined to providing only one type of financial service: banking, insurance, or securities. This restriction had its roots in the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, a law enacted in the aftermath of the Great Depression to reduce risk in the financial sector by separating these services.</p>

            Financial Services Integration</xref>:</b> GLBA has allowed institutions to offer a combination of banking, insurance, and securities services.
