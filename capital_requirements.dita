  <glossdef>In the context of banking and financial regulation, capital requirements refer to the minimum amount of equity a bank must hold as a percentage of its risk-weighted assets. These requirements are put in place by regulatory authorities to ensure banks can absorb a reasonable amount of loss and comply with their obligation to depositors and other creditors. In the Basel III regulations, capital requirements are significantly increased to improve the resilience and stability of the global banking system.</glossdef>
